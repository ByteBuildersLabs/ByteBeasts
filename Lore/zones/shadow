**Location: The Umbral Forest 🐦‍⬛**

Description: The Umbral Forest is a dense woodland perpetually enveloped in darkness, where the canopy is so thick that sunlight barely penetrates. Twisted trees reach toward the sky, and the ground is covered by a carpet of shadowy moss. Ancient tombs and forgotten crypts are scattered throughout, their entrances guarded by ominous statues. Wisps of mist weave among the trees, and whispers seem to emanate from the shadows themselves. This mysterious forest is the realm of the Shadow beasts, creatures that thrive in darkness and enigma.
