**Location: The Glacial CavernsðŸ’ **

Description: Hidden beneath the frozen tundras lie the Glacial Caverns, an extensive network of ice caves and tunnels. The walls are adorned with sparkling crystals that refract light into a spectrum of colors, illuminating the caverns with an ethereal glow. Stalactites and stalagmites of pure ice create natural sculptures, and the air is filled with a soft, melodious tinkling as the crystals resonate with the slightest vibrations. This mystical underground world is home to the elusive Crystal beasts, which blend seamlessly with the shimmering environment.
