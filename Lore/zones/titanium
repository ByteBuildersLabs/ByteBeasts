**Location: The Iron Citadel**

Description: The Iron Citadel is an expansive metallic metropolis where towering spires and intricate machinery dominate the skyline. Gears the size of buildings turn slowly, powered by steam and arcane energies. Bridges and walkways crisscross high above the ground, connecting factories and workshops that never sleep. The air is filled with the rhythmic sounds of metal clanging and the hiss of steam. This industrial world is inhabited by the Titanium beasts, mechanical creatures forged in metal and animated by mysterious forces.
