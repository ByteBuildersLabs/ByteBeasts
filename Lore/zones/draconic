**Location: The Dragon's Summit**

Description: Towering above the clouds, the Dragon's Summit is a colossal mountain range characterized by its steep cliffs and fiery chasms. Rivers of molten lava trace paths through the rocky terrain, casting a warm amber glow that contrasts with the dark stone. Ancient ruins and colossal statues hint at a long-forgotten civilization. The skies are often streaked with trails of smoke as draconic beasts take flight, their roars echoing through the valleys. This rugged landscape is as majestic as it is treacherous, embodying the raw power of its draconic inhabitants.
